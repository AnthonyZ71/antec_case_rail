# Antec Case Rail

Replacement rails for an Antec case.
I was repurposing one of my computers to be an [Unraid](https://unraid.net/) server, and while moving things around, I broke one of the rails that hold in the hard drives.
I looked at other rail designs on thingiverse, but couldn't find one I liked.
Beyond simply fitting the case, I wanted it to not take screws.
I could not find an existing rail that did both, so I created this rail.
